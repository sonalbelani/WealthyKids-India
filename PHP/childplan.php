             In a child plan, there are two components–
        <b>Insurance and Investment</b></br>
  
           The investment component is designed to meet the financial needs of the child through accumulation of
                money by investing in various instruments.</br>

            <br>
            For every child plan you need to pay a premium amount which is based on the maturity benefit you opt
                          
            The policy term depends on the child’s age at the time of taking the child plan to determine the stages
                of his life where he will need the money and how much will he need.

          The money can withdrawn for the corpus after 5 years depending upon the requirement of the child, be it,
                college fees for higher education or medical illness or marriage

            
         The child plan is accepted as a valid security against loans. In case you need emergency funds,<br> you can
                use the plan to raise funds.</b>
